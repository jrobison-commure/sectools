Here's an example of how you can use Okta's RBAC to control access to specific resources within your organization:

# Import the necessary Okta libraries
```bash
import okta
from okta.models import Role, RoleAssignment

# Create a new role in Okta
new_role = Role(name="platform-infrastructure Team", description="Access to platform-infrastructure resources")
okta_client.create_role(new_role)

# Assign the new role to a user
user_id = "1234567890"
role_id = new_role.id
role_assignment = RoleAssignment(scope_type="USER", scope_id=user_id, role_id=role_id)
okta_client.create_role_assignment(role_assignment)
```

In this example, we create a new role called "Sales Team" with a description of "Access to sales resources". We then assign this role to a specific user with the ID "1234567890". This user will now have access to any resources that are associated with the "Sales Team" role.

It's important to note that the specific implementation of RBAC will vary depending on your organization's needs and the resources you are trying to protect. Okta provides a flexible framework for implementing RBAC, but it's up to you to determine the specific roles and permissions that are necessary for your organization.
